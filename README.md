This C program prompts the user to enter their name, calculates the length of the name, and prints the name in reverse. </br>
The program begins by defining a character array to store the user's input. </br>
It then uses scanf to read the name and calculates its length by iterating through the array until it reaches the null terminator ('\0'). </br>
The program then prints the length of the name, followed by the name itself in reverse order by accessing the array elements from the last index to the first. </br>
It is a simple program that demonstrates string handling, array indexing, and basic input/output operations in C.
